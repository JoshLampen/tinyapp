# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full-stack web application where can shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly), manage their entries, and track data such as visits and unique visitors.

- Front End: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Back End: Node, Express, EJS
- Test: Mocha and Chai

*I note the use of inline CSS for this project. Moving the CSS to a separate file, and expanding its use, will be a key focus for my next project.*
